# Welcome to AES!

AES is a powerful and intuitive event system designed specifically for the Unreal Engine!

The primary goal of AES is to give you the ability to easily **decouple** your game systems from one another. The `AES Subsystem` sits as a mediator between all of the other systems that need to communicate with each other. This frees your systems from having dependencies and allows you to reuse them in other projects without tearing everything apart or migrating unrelated content over to your new projects.

With AES, you can easily register any object for various type of events `Broadcast`, `Type`, `Focus` and `Whisper` events. Whether you're looking to create general events or targeted messaging between objects, AES has you covered!

Our system is designed with flexibility in mind, and is extremely user friendly as it's **100% fully Blueprint exposed**, making it quick and easy to set up within minutes. We understand that game development can be a time-consuming process, which is why we've worked hard to ensure that AES is both lightweight and small in size, enabling you to focus on creating the best possible gameplay experience for your players.

Written in C++, AES is optimized for performance, and we've gone the extra mile to ensure that our system is cache-friendly. Unlike other event systems, we use **parallel sorted arrays** and **binary searches** in lieu of maps, allowing you to streamline your event handling with ease.

We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of Unreal Engine development. Our system has been thoroughly tested and works seamlessly with the **latest engine versions**, even before their release. We also provide simple and clear documentation and examples to help you get started with the system quickly and easily.

So, whether you're a seasoned game developer or just starting out, AES is the perfect choice for anyone looking to streamline their event handling and take their game to the next level. With our powerful and intuitive system, you can create truly immersive and engaging gameplay experiences that your players will love!
